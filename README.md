# Supervised-Learning-in-R
Supervised learning in R using Caret package.

I have implemented simple scripts for the following algorithms:
1. k-nearest neighbor
2. Decision Tree based classifier using J48 algorithm
3. Linear Regression
4. Naive Bayes
5. Neural Network

I have also included a script to show the density and scatter plot of the dataset.

"Classification Using R.pdf" contains details about the softwares (R, RStudio) and package (caret) required for implementation, as well as the implementation details about the algorithms.
